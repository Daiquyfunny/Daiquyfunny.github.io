    <p class="about">Hello! I'm Daniel a lazy-ass roblox developer who
   makes no succesful games, but hey! I promised my self
   to make a 1 successful playable game for y'all! Only
   if I got times to do it. I was really intrested in
   coding so here,
   I created my own website. Also I run a Discord
   bot, the invite link for the bot is at the "Projects"
   category. I've learned 3 programming
   languages: Lua(Roblox), Lua and discord.py. Currently learning
   Javascript and Python, that's my goal. Now aside from being
   a developer, I like drawing stuff, playing tetris, I
   kind of moving from Roblox to tetris so uhh... I
   sometimes listen
   to musics from an only artist I like. Enjoy riding skateboard. There's also more but I hate to list it all out lol.
